## Questions?

What questions do you have? What would like us to take a close look at when reviewing your HW?
1. How does the tempalte know which div we are referring to? If there were multiple divs on the page, how do we tell the template which one it is controlling?

2. I feel like "if, else if" statements for checking if the number is below 0 or less than 100 are incorrect.

3. My code keeps throwing an error on JS line 23 and I can't figure out why - I think it's becuase my renderNumber function is messed up

4. In my template, I put {{formatNumber}} instead of {{text}} like we had in the example in class - is this incorrect? I want it to read as a number value, not a text value.
